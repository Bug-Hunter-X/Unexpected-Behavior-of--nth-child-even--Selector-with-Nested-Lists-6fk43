The following CSS code snippet intends to style list items, but it produces unexpected results.  The `:nth-child(n)` selector is supposed to target every even-numbered list item, but it doesn't work as expected.

```css
li:nth-child(even) {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}
```

The problem is that `:nth-child(even)` selects every other element in the list, regardless of whether it's a direct child of the `<ul>` or `<ol>` element.
