# CSS :nth-child(even) Selector Issue

This repository demonstrates a problem with the CSS `:nth-child(even)` selector when dealing with nested lists.  The selector doesn't function as expected when dealing with lists containing nested lists, resulting in inconsistent styling.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS.  The `bugSolution.css` file shows a corrected approach.  This issue highlights the importance of carefully considering the specificity and context of CSS selectors when working with complex layouts.
