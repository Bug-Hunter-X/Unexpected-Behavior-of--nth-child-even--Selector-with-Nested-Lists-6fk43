To correctly style every other direct child list item, use the `:nth-child(2n)` selector, making it clear that you are targeting every other element directly under the parent.

```css
li:nth-child(2n) {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}
```

This ensures that the styling applies consistently across the intended elements and prevents unexpected behavior stemming from selector ambiguity.
